We have gone from having just launched basic event support, trialing it at our first major event (Cancon), to having had over 5.5k events hosted on Aftergame this year! From a few friends playing weekly game nights through to nation-wide communities, we are now home to hundreds of gaming groups around the world.

Here's a look back at some of the key milestones of this past year:

## Logging plays got game-specific
Over the year, we added support for team-based games, pre-defined and custom roles, scenarios, RPGs, game timers, score calculator keyboards, adding photos and threaded-discussions on play logs. We have also been busy defining games, which is a process where we read the rulebook and set within the Aftergame platform all play details about a game, which updates the app interface and pre-fills values tailored to that specific game. **Our team have now defined over 1,000 of the most popular games!** This means you spend less time writing down everyone's roles and more time playing games!

## Events expanded and became self-serve
Until April, all events on Aftergame were manually created by our team. This changed with the ability for anyone to [create events and meetups](https://aftergame.notion.site/create-an-event-eb097129f9034b67ae59d2f8d7ee4848?pvs=4) on Aftergame for free. We quickly added the ability to attach game lists, create recurring events, add ticket information, allow guests to post in events and more!

## Aftergame got a premium subscription
[Aftergame+](https://www.aftergame.co/plus) was launched to unlock extra features in the app and provide a way for people to support development of our ambitious platform. We are so grateful for all our amazing supporters who enable us to keep developing our vision of a social tabletop platform.

## Gather your group
In late July, we finally added groups to the app. It started out simple but has evolved into a place where group members can post discussions, see the upcoming games in the group calendar, and browse through the combined group collection. We are still early days with groups and see it as a central part of our platform with an exciting backlog of features to come!

## Scheduling on the main stage
In October, we were thrilled to be used by Let's Play Games and VR Distribution for scheduling game demos and learn to plays of the latest games at PAX Aus. This was supported by countless improvements to scheduling throughout the year. To name just a few additions, we added time zone support for those travelling, the ability to add a game master or teacher, content ratings, many filters to the game schedule, and a new view which breaks the day down in a clear way.

## Managing your game collection
Your game collection is a core part of the app. We introduced a number of improvements to help you manage the important aspects of your collections, including the ability to have multiple copies of a game, custom game lists, better sorting, adding details like price to your copies of games, and importing from CSV.

## Your gaming feed
To close off the year, we transformed the home screen into a chronological feed of everything happening in *your* gaming world. We combined posts, events, planned games, and play logs all into one place so you never miss anything relevant to you. Along with the feed, we added the ability to post photos and polls to bring discussions to life.

## Looking forward to 2025
I can not wait for what we plan to bring in 2025. Our first focus is on launching a full web version of our platform and improving emails/notifications. Once this is released, we have a whole raft of updates we will be bringing to events, groups, stats, and play logging. While this year was building a lot of foundations and catching up, in the new year we will finally be able to bring some features which will be unique to Aftergame.
