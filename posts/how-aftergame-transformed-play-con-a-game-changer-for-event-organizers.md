Organizers have been using Aftergame at conventions for over a year now, so we thought it was the perfect time to reflect on how the app changes the convention experience. To explore this, we sat down with Jules, one of the organizers of Play Con and co-host of the Board Game BBQ podcast, to hear his insights on what Aftergame has brought to the table.

### Why Play Con Chose Aftergame

*“The number one reason was to give attendees the power in their hands to connect and craft their experience at the event,”* Jules explained when discussing why Play Con adopted Aftergame. Like many conventions, Play Con offers plenty of free play opportunities and *“Aftergame, we thought, was the perfect tool to allow people to make the most of that free play time”* empowering attendees to seamlessly connect with others and curate their event experiences.

### Features That Made a Difference

From the start, two features stood out to the Play Con organizers:

1. **Participant-led Organization**: Attendees could organize their own games while the Play Con team managed official activities in the same space. *“Seeing a comprehensive list of all activities – official and unofficial – in one place is extremely valuable,”* Jules noted.
2. **Game Filtering**: The ability to filter games by type or weight was a hit. *“Participants that like	lighter games could filter and see what’s available,”* Jules shared. This customization allowed attendees to curate their time.

*“The more you dig into the filters and the features, the more people can really craft their experience at each event.”*

### Elevating the Attendee Experience

Attendees loved how Aftergame simplified connections. *“They didn’t have to wander around asking, ‘Is this a free seat?’ They could just book in the games they were interested in playing and hit the ground running.”* Booking seats also meant players were getting the most out of their tickets. *“It gave people the opportunity, if they wanted to use the tool to its full potential, to book those back-to-back games. They just weren't wasting any time,”* said Jules.

*“The response from people was overwhelmingly positive. People said they got to play with other people that they’ve never met before and have a great time, that it was easy to understand and to use and it really gave people an easy launching point into the event.”* One memorable moment came when Jules helped a woman in her late seventies use Aftergame. She’d booked a game but couldn’t find its location. *“I told her to scroll down so she could see the chat feature,”* said Jules, *“and, sure enough, the person had messaged saying ‘I’m at this table’ and she was like ‘Ah, that’s fantastic!’”*

Jules summed up: *“I loved seeing that people of all ages were using the app and getting a good experience out of it.”*

### Beyond Conventions: Casual Game Days

Aftergame isn’t just for conventions. It’s equally effective for smaller, more casual game days. *“It saves the whole ‘okay, we’ve all rocked up, what do we want to play?’ dilemma,”* Jules shared. Attendees can set intentions beforehand, reducing indecision and maximizing gameplay.

### Fostering Community

Even in its early days, Aftergame has shown promise in building community. *“We were a very big supporter pretty early on and saw the value in events that we ran beyond Play Con and the local game days.”* Jules now sees all kinds of local game groups and small meetups adopting the app, with players appreciating features like game stats and sign-ups. *“It’s been really cool to see more people using it,”* he shared. *“I think it has better connected people.”*

### Using Data to Shape Events

Aftergame also provides insights into attendee preferences. Knowing the most-played games at Play Con, for example, helped the team better understand their audience. This data can also help identify new opportunities, hone the game library, or determine how to focus future events. *“As we collect more data over time, it starts to help us get a better picture of what kind of extra events we could put on,”* says Jules.

### Why Organizers Should Consider Aftergame

Would Jules recommend Aftergame to other organizers? *“Absolutely! It’s such a great way to help people get the most out of their time at the event,”* he emphasized. *“I see it as a really powerful tool for people to connect and break down some of the social barriers or social awkwardness of trying to find a game, especially if you’re attending an event on your own.”* Helping people join games, forge connections, and make the most of their time are great reasons to give it a go from an attendee's perspective. There are also a whole host of organizational tools to make planning and admin so much easier, giving you time to enjoy your own event.

### Looking Ahead: Aftergame’s Future

We’re constantly evolving Aftergame to meet the needs of organizers and attendees alike. Features like the Play-to-Win and integrated game libraries are just the beginning. *“It’s not too far in the future where it really will be a one-stop shop for all your event needs,”* Jules concluded.
