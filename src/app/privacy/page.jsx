            <p className="mb-4">A business that supports our website, products and services may be located outside of New Zealand (the country where we are incorporated) and also outside of the country where you are located. This means that the personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored in, a country outside of New Zealand and the country where you are located.</p>

Under the GDPR, the transfer of personal information to a country outside the EEA may take place where the European Commission has decided that the country ensures an adequate level of protection. In the absence of an adequacy decision, we may transfer personal information if other appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Where we transfer personal information outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EEA data, or to a third party where approved transfer mechanisms are in place to protect your personal information (e.g. by entering into the European Commission’s <a className="text-gg-blue font-medium hover:underline" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Standard Contractual Clauses</a>).

New Zealand is recognized by the European Commission as a country that has an adequate level of data protection and we rely on this decision in transferring personal information to New Zealand.</p>
            
            <h4 className="mt-10 mb-2 text-xl font-medium">PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">As required by applicable law, we will take steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks inherent in processing personal information.</p>

Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">When you request a correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change your personal information, we will make the correction. In all other cases, we will take reasonable steps to make a note of the personal information that was the subject of your correction request.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at <a className="text-gg-blue font-medium hover:underline" href="mailto:privacy@aftergame.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">privacy@aftergame.co</a>. Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information to be corrected and the correction that you are requesting).</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Subject to applicable law, we may charge you our reasonable costs of providing to you copies of your personal information or correcting that information.</p>

We suggest you review that website’s privacy policy before you provide personal information to that owner or website.</p>
            
            <h4 className="mt-10 mb-2 text-xl font-medium">DATA RETENTION POLICY</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">The personal information that we collect and use will not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is collected, or for the duration required for compliance with applicable law, whichever is longer.</p>

            <h4 className="mt-10 mb-2 text-xl font-medium">WHAT ARE COOKIES</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your browsing device, e.g. a computer or smartphone, when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them, or by other websites that use the same cookies. This helps a website know if the browsing device has visited that or other websites before.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Cookies can be used to collect information relating to your use of a website or your device, let you navigate between pages effectively, help to remember your preferences and generally improve your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure advertising you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Cookies can be <em>session</em> or <em>persistent</em> cookies. <em>Session</em> cookies are temporary and only stay on your browser until you stop browsing. <em>Persistent</em> cookies stay on your device until they expire or are deleted.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">The cookies used on our website may be first party cookies (i.e. set by us) or third party cookies (i.e. cookies set on our website by a person other than us). The third party companies that place cookies on our website will have their own privacy policies.</p>
            
            <h4 className="mt-10 mb-2 text-xl font-medium">WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">The types of cookies used by us, and most websites, can generally be categorised as follows.</p>
            <h5 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold">Strictly necessary cookies</h5>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies are essential for the full functionality of our website and related services. They enable you to navigate around our website and services and use their features e.g. accessing secure areas and enabling services that you have asked to receive. If you opt out of these cookies, you may not be able to access all the functions of our website and some services that you have asked to receive.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies do not track where else you have been on the internet and do not remember your preferences beyond your current visit. These cookies are generally first party session cookies which will expire when you close your browsing session. These cookies do not collect information that could be used for marketing purposes.</p>
            <h5 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold">Functionality cookies</h5>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. e.g. these cookies allow us to remember the settings you have applied to the website (such as font size, preferences or colours), identify whether you are a returning website visitor and present you with a personalised version of the website, or eliminate the need for you to re-enter your login details. The information these cookies collect is generally anonymous and they do not track your browsing activity on other websites. These cookies may be first or third party, session or persistent cookies.</p>
            <h5 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold">Performance cookies</h5>
            <p className="mb-4">These cookies collect information about how you use a website, e.g. which pages are the most visited and if you receive any error message from any page. This information helps us improve the way our website and related services work and helps us manage the performance and design of the website and services.

These cookies may be first or third party, session or persistent cookies.</p>
            <h5 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold">Targeting cookies</h5>
            <p className="mb-4">Targeting cookies are used to present advertising that is relevant to you and your interests. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits e.g. the pages you have visited and the links you have followed across the internet. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These cookies will usually be persistent but time-limited and may be placed on our website by third party service providers or advertising partners with our permission.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">We use targeting cookies to present interest-based advertising on our website and for retargeting. This is a form of interest-based advertising that enables our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you advertising based on your browsing activity across the internet, including to allow us to advertise to people who previously visited our website.</p>
            
            <h4 className="mt-10 mb-2 text-xl font-medium">GOOGLE COOKIES</h4>
