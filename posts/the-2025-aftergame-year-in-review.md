## No longer just an app
Our first major update of the year was to role out a full web version of Aftergame. This was huge effort to rebuild the app from scratch so that we could use the same codebase universally, across all platforms. This means we can now provide an amazing experience on both mobile and web apps and this has unlocked the ability to open access to many areas of the platform without an account. The rebuild also allowed us to launch [embeddable views](https://aftergame.notion.site/organizers#24c176cc981d80aeab0ec3fd4e185848), where you can embed a sleek view of your event schedule or game library into your website with just one line of HTML!

## Building the Aftergame community
This year alone, we had **over 500 gaming clubs and communities start using Aftergame** to schedule events and organise games. We're incredibly proud to offer support to all those organisers who do such an incredible job of building communities around our favourite hobby. Supporting groups is a key focus. We added the ability the ability pin important posts, control who joins a group, tag and mention people in comments, view group stats and browse game leaderboards. We also brought on our first official publisher groups to power their event schedules and organised play, something we are very excited to see grow in the new year.

## Conventions that pop
We were lucky enough to partner with 34 conventions in 2025 and have expanded our functionality to support the best experience for hosts and attendees alike. Working with the wonderful folk at Wellycon, we built the ability to run Play to Win competitions which allows attendees to enter the draw to win the game they just played (with [over 8k entries clocked in at Wellycon](https://aftergame.app/events/418c6737-41e6-4297-864b-269bb46e0d36) alone!) We also added functionality like clash detection, supporting rooms & tables, and adding non-gaming events to the schedule, to name just a few new features for large events.

## What an eventful year
Of course we aren't just used for conventions, **in 2025 we had almost 7k meetups and over 15k games planned through Aftergame!** We are thrilled by the number of organisers trusting us, particularly given it was only just last year that you could create events on our platform. This year we kept improving events at the forefront of our efforts. We added waitlists, the ability to control who can view or join an event (and when), planning games without a set time, reserving seats, response notes, the ability to duplicate events and so much more.

## Keeping players at the core
As more players start using Aftergame to support their gaming life and with **over 250k plays logged on our platform this year**, we've kept updating the core experience. We want players to love using Aftergame beyond events (and selfishly, add features we ourselves want!) Play logs now look way nicer, we support games with multiple roles or scenarios, it’s no longer just win or lose - set who came second etc, select the starting player, and adding games to your collection is much easier.

## Constantly evolving
**This year saw well over 300 new features and improvements** to the platform! We are striving to build the best possible platform for the board game and tabletop community and are constantly iterating. This is in large part supported by our fantastic community. We’ve received hundreds of bug reports, feature requests, and feedback over the year. This informs so much of what we do and we always welcome more input! Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XMYxvJ3ge2) or send us an email to help shape Aftergame.

## Some big changes coming in 2026
Next year is going to be huge for the platform. We are close to launching our own ticketing platform, enabling events to be completely run through Aftergame. We will also be adding group and direct messaging, one of the most requested features. This will help so much for making planning a seamless experience. Beyond this our focus will be on better supporting large-scale organised play, expanding event capabilities, and making local groups, retailers, spaces, and events more discoverable. Finally, we will of course keep adding to and improving  our existing functionality, constantly striving to make Aftergame as good as it possibly can be!
